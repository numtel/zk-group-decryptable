# zk-group-decryptable

An adaptation of [Semaphore v4](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/feat/semaphore-v4) simplified and using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for the contracts while also adding the ability to decrypt proofs using STARK-friendly asymmetric ElGamal encryption as implemented by [Shigoto-dev19](https://github.com/Shigoto-dev19/ec-elgamal-circom)
